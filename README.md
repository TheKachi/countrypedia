## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode _(optional)_

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Vue JS](https://v2.vuejs.org/) - JS library
- [Nuxt JS](https://nuxjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [Axios](https://axios.com/) - For REST APIs

### What I learned

Building this out helped reinforce my knowledge of Vue hand in hand with all the other tools listed. It also helped me practise and understand how filtering and searching works.

### Continued development

Although this is a completed and efficient solution I probably would refactor later by adding state management with Vuex.
